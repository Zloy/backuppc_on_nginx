#
# Configuration file for BackupPC.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This is the main configuration file for BackupPC.
#
#   This file must be valid perl source, so make sure the punctuation,
#   quotes, and other syntax are valid.
#
#   This file is read by BackupPC at startup, when a HUP (-1) signal
#   is sent to BackupPC and also at each wakeup time whenever the
#   modification time of this file changes.
#
#   The configuration parameters are divided into four general groups.
#   The first group (general server configuration) provides general
#   configuration for BackupPC.  The next two groups describe what
#   to backup, when to do it, and how long to keep it.  The fourth
#   group are settings for the CGI http interface.
#
#   Configuration settings can also be specified on a per-PC basis.
#   Simply put the relevant settings in a config.pl file in the
#   PC's backup directory (ie: in __TOPDIR__/pc/hostName).
#   All configuration settings in the second, third and fourth
#   groups can be overridden by the per-PC config.pl file.

# TCP port number on which the BackupPC server listens for and accepts
# connections.  Normally this should be disabled (set to -1).  The TCP
# port is only needed if apache runs on a different machine from BackupPC.
# In that case, set this to any spare port number over 1024 (eg: 2359).
# If you enable the TCP port, make sure you set $Conf{ServerMesgSecret}
# too!

#
# Shared secret to make the TCP port secure.  Set this to a hard to guess
# string if you enable the TCP port (ie: $Conf{ServerPort} > 0).
#
# To avoid possible attacks via the TCP socket interface, every client
# message is protected by an MD5 digest. The MD5 digest includes four
# items:
#   - a seed that is sent to the client when the connection opens
#   - a sequence number that increments for each message
#   - a shared secret that is stored in $Conf{ServerMesgSecret}
#   - the message itself.
#
# The message is sent in plain text preceded by the MD5 digest.  A
# snooper can see the plain-text seed sent by BackupPC and plain-text
# message from the client, but cannot construct a valid MD5 digest since
# the secret $Conf{ServerMesgSecret} is unknown.  A replay attack is
# not possible since the seed changes on a per-connection and
# per-message basis.

# If the hosts you are backing up are always connected to the network
# you might have only one or two wakeups each night.  This will keep
# the backup activity after hours.  On the other hand, if you are backing
# up laptops that are only intermittently connected to the network you
# will want to have frequent wakeups (eg: hourly) to maximize the chance

#
# Each night, at the first wakeup listed in $Conf{WakeupSchedule},

# in the pool, ie: files that only have one link.  To avoid race
# conditions, BackupPC_nightly and BackupPC_link cannot run at
# the same time.  Starting in v3.0.0, BackupPC_nightly can run
# concurrently with backups (BackupPC_dump).

# How many days (runs) it takes BackupPC_nightly to traverse the
# entire pool.  Normally this is 1, which means every night it runs,
# it does traverse the entire pool removing unused pool files.
#
# Other valid values are 2, 4, 8, 16.  This causes BackupPC_nightly to
# traverse 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 or 1/16th of the pool each night, meaning it
# takes 2, 4, 8 or 16 days to completely traverse the pool.  The
# advantage is that each night the running time of BackupPC_nightly
# is reduced roughly in proportion, since the total job is split
# over multiple days.  The disadvantage is that unused pool files
# take longer to get deleted, which will slightly increase disk
# usage.
#
# Note that even when $Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod} > 1, BackupPC_nightly
# still runs every night.  It just does less work each time it runs.

#
# If filling of incremental dumps is off the oldest backup always
# has to be a full (ie: filled) dump.  This might mean one or two
# extra full dumps are kept until the oldest incremental backups expire.
#
# Exponential backup expiry is also supported.  This allows you to specify:
#
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 1 * $Conf{FullPeriod}, followed by
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 2 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 8 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 16 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#
# and so on.  This works by deleting every other full as each expiry
# boundary is crossed.
#
# Exponential expiry is specified using an array for $Conf{FullKeepCnt}:
#
#   $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4, 2, 3];
#
# Entry #n specifies how many fulls to keep at an interval of
# 2^n * $Conf{FullPeriod} (ie: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...).
#
# The example above specifies keeping 4 of the most recent full backups
# (1 week interval) two full backups at 2 week intervals, and 3 full
# backups at 4 week intervals, eg:
#
#    full 0 19 weeks old   \
#    full 1 15 weeks old    >---  3 backups at 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod}
#    full 2 11 weeks old   /

#    full 7  1 week old     /
#    full 8  current       /
#
# On a given week the spacing might be less than shown as each backup
# ages through each expiry period.  For example, one week later, a
# new full is completed and the oldest is deleted, giving:
#
#    full 0 16 weeks old   \
#    full 1 12 weeks old    >---  3 backups at 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod}
#    full 2  8 weeks old   /

#    full 4  4 weeks old   /
#    full 5  3 weeks old   \

#    full 7  1 week old     /
#    full 8  current       /
#
# You can specify 0 as a count (except in the first entry), and the

#
#   $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2];
#
# This will keep 10 full dumps, 4 most recent at 1 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
# followed by 4 at an interval of 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod} (approx 1 month
# apart), and then 2 at an interval of 32 * $Conf{FullPeriod} (approx
# 7-8 months apart).
#

#
# The entries of $Conf{IncrLevels} apply in order to each
# incremental after each full backup.  It wraps around until
# the next full backup.  For example, these two settings
# have the same effect:
#
#       $Conf{IncrLevels} = [1, 2, 3];
#       $Conf{IncrLevels} = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3];

# 6th) backups just go back to the immediate preceeding
# incremental.
#
# Specifying a sequence of multi-level incrementals will
# usually mean more than $Conf{IncrKeepCnt} incrementals will
# need to be kept, since lower level incrementals are needed
# to merge a complete view of a backup.  For example, with
#
#       $Conf{FullPeriod}  = 7;
#       $Conf{IncrPeriod}  = 1;
#       $Conf{IncrKeepCnt} = 6;
#       $Conf{IncrLevels}  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

#       backup #10 (incr, level 3)
#       backup #11 (incr, level 4)
#       backup #12 (incr, level 5, newest)
#
# Backup #1 (the oldest level 1 incremental) can't be deleted
# since backups 2..6 depend on it.  Those 6 incrementals can't
# all be deleted since that would only leave 5 (#8..12).
# When the next incremental happens (level 6), the complete
# set of 6 older incrementals (#1..6) will be deleted, since
# that maintains the required number ($Conf{IncrKeepCnt})
# of incrementals.  This situation is reduced if you set
# shorter chains of multi-level incrementals, eg:
#
#       $Conf{IncrLevels}  = [1, 2, 3];
#
# would only have up to 2 extra incremenals before all 3
# are deleted.
#
# BackupPC as usual merges the full and the sequence
# of incrementals together so each incremental can be
# browsed and restored as though it is a complete backup.
# If you specify a long chain of incrementals then more
# backups need to be merged when browsing, restoring,
# or getting the starting point for rsync backups.
# In the example above (levels 1..6), browing backup
# #6 requires 7 different backups (#0..6) to be merged.
#
# Because of this merging and the additional incrementals
# that need to be kept, it is recommended that some
# level 1 incrementals be included in $Conf{IncrLevels}.

# In v1.4.0 and later the default is off.
#
# BackupPC, and the cgi interface in particular, do the right thing on
# un-filled incremental backups.  It will correctly display the merged
# incremental backup with the most recent filled backup, giving the
# un-filled incremental backups a filled appearance.  That means it
# invisible to the user whether incremental dumps are filled or not.
#
# Filling backups takes a little extra disk space, and it does cost
# some extra disk activity for filling, and later removal.  Filling
# is no longer useful, since file mangling and compression doesn't
# make a filled backup very useful. It's likely the filling option

# The exact behavior is determined by the underlying transport program,

# the X option.  Simple shell wild-cards using "*" or "?" are allowed.
#
# For tar, if the exclude file contains a "/" it is assumed to be anchored
# at the start of the string.  Since all the tar paths start with "./",
# BackupPC prepends a "." if the exclude file starts with a "/".  Note
# that GNU tar version >= 1.13.7 is required for the exclude option to
# work correctly.  For linux or unix machines you should add
# "/proc" to $Conf{BackupFilesExclude} unless you have specified
# --one-file-system in $Conf{TarClientCmd} or --one-file-system in
# $Conf{RsyncArgs}.  Also, for tar, do not use a trailing "/" in
# the directory name: a trailing "/" causes the name to not match
# and the directory will not be excluded.

# Users report that for smbclient you should specify a directory
# followed by "/*", eg: "/proc/*", instead of just "/proc".

# to "blackout" and not backed up during hours and days specified by

#
# To allow for periodic rebooting of a PC or other brief periods when a
# PC is not on the network, a number of consecutive bad pings is allowed
# before the good ping count is reset. This parameter is

# Note that bad and good pings don't occur with the same interval. If a
# machine is always on the network, it will only be pinged roughly once

# machine to be subject to blackout. On the other hand, if a ping is
# failed, it will be retried roughly every time BackupPC wakes up, eg,
# every one or two hours. So a setting for $Conf{BlackoutBadPingLimit} of
# 3 means that the PC will lose its blackout status after 3-6 hours of
# unavailability.
#
# To disable the blackout feature set $Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt} to a negative
# value.  A value of 0 will make all machines subject to blackout.  But

#
#   - 'rsyncd':  backup and restore via rsync daemon on the client.
#                Best choice for linux/unix if you have rsyncd running on
#                the client.  Good choice also for WinXX.
#
#   - 'tar':    backup and restore via tar, tar over ssh, rsh or nfs.
#               Good choice for linux/unix.
#
#   - 'archive': host is a special archive host.  Backups are not done.
#                An archive host is used to archive other host's backups

# on the server for filename encoding.  If this is empty, then

# to/from utf8 automatically during backup and restore.
#
# If the file names displayed in the browser (eg: accents or special
# characters) don't look right then it is likely you haven't set
# $Conf{ClientCharset} correctly.
#
# If you are using smbclient on a WinXX machine, smbclient will convert
# to the "unix charset" setting in smb.conf.  The default is utf8,
# in which case leave $Conf{ClientCharset} empty since smbclient does
# the right conversion.
#
# If you are using rsync on a WinXX machine then it does no conversion.
# A typical WinXX encoding for latin1/western europe is 'cp1252',
# so in this case set $Conf{ClientCharset} to 'cp1252'.
#
# On a linux or unix client, run "locale charmap" to see the client's
# charset.  Set $Conf{ClientCharset} to this value.  A typical value
# for english/US is 'ISO-8859-1'.

# Normal users can only access information specific to their host.
# They can start/stop/browse/restore backups.
#
# Administrative users have full access to all hosts, plus overall
# status and log information.
#
# The administrative users are the union of the unix/linux group
# $Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup} and the manual list of users, separated
# by spaces, in $Conf{CgiAdminUsers}. If you don't want a group or
# manual list of users set the corresponding configuration setting
# to undef or an empty string.
#
# If you want every user to have admin privileges (careful!), set
# $Conf{CgiAdminUsers} = '*'.
#
# Examples:
#    $Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup} = 'admin';
#    $Conf{CgiAdminUsers}     = 'craig celia';
#    --> administrative users are the union of group admin, plus
