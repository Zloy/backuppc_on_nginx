# Host file list for BackupPC.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This file lists all the hosts that should be backed up by
#   BackupPC.
#
#   Each line in the hosts file contains three fields, separated
#   by white space:
#
#     - The host name.  If this host is a static IP address this
#       must the machine's IP host name (ie: something that can
#       be looked up using nslookup or DNS).  If this is a DHCP
#       host then the host name must be the netbios name of the
#       machine.  It is possible to have a host name that contains
#       spaces, but that is discouraged.  Escape a space with "\", eg:
#
#                craigs\ pc
#
#     - DHCP flag.  Set to 0 if this is a static IP address host
#       or if the machine can be found using nmblookup.  Otherwise,
#       if the client can only be found by looking through the DHCP
#       pool then set this to 1.
#
#     - User name (unix login/email name) of the user who "owns"
#       or uses this machine.  This is the user who will be sent
#       email about this machine, and this user will have permission
#       to stop/start/browse/restore backups for this host.  This
#       user name must match the name the user authenticates with
#       via apache.
#
#     - Optional additional user names (comma separated, no white space) of
#       users who are also allowed to stop/start/browse/restore backups
#       for this client via the CGI interface.  These users are not sent
#       email.  These do not need to be valid email names; they simply
#       need to match the name the user authenticates with via apache.
